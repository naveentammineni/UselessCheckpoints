Implementing the Communication based distributed algorithm for avoiding Useless Checkpoints using Java
=======================================================================================================

Designed an algorithm for avoiding useless checkpoints that can support any checkpoint algorithms. Based on the protocol from Helary’s paper on “Preventing Useless Checkpoints in Distributed Computations”, this application can effectively avoid useless checkpoints for any application running in distributed architecture.
